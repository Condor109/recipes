    <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
    <p>
      Tequeños is usually described as a fried breaded cheese stick or spear of bread dough with fresh cheese stuffed in the middle.
      They are eaten as snacks in parties or as a side appetizer. Their name comes from <strong>Los Teques</strong>, a city in Venezuela where a wealthy
      family invented them.

    <p>
      There are multiple variations, such as <em>Peruvian Tequeños</em>, where Wantán dough is used and other fillings can be used. In this recipe we
      will follow the previously mentioned dish, as in my opinion it is more simple. And no, there will be no recipe for guacamole. I mean, you just
      have to destroy your avocado and add lemon onion and tomato.
