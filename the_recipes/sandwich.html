    <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
    <p>
      According to Wikipedia, the sandwich  is named after <strong>John Montagu</strong>, 4th Earl of Sandwich, an eighteenth-century English aristocrat.[8][9] 
      It is commonly said that Lord Sandwich, during long sessions of cribbage and other card games at public gambling houses, would order
      his valet to bring him salt beef between two pieces of toasted bread.
